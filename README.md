## Description

_Duration: Weekend Sprint_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A browser of choice. 

## Installation

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Observe the images on your DOM.
2. Appreciate the beauty of said images. 
3. If you would like to know a little bit more about the image, clicking on it will show you a description.
4. Click on the description to show the image and vide-versa. 
5. You may also click on the love button, and the counter will update. 


## Built With

1. CSS
2. HTML
3. Node
4. Postico
5. VS Code
6. PostgreSQL
7. Javascript
8. Material UI
